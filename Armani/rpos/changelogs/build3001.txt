Modifications to consider for 3.0.0.1


Renamed the ra.bat file in "bin" to rb.bat, make sure we copy this into the 2.6.0.7 releases as well
 
Core has not been split into Core/Platform.

BIG CHANGE.  There are now more jar files due to the project split:
   OLD            NEW
   ---            ---
   cms_core       retek_platform
                  retek_common
                  retek_pos
                  retek_time
   chelsea_store  retek_shared_common
                  retek_shared_pos
                  retek_shared_time
