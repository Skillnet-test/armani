Modifications to consider for 2.6.0.2

1.  Sale Tax changes: We have moved sale tax implementations to a new jar 
file - cms_tax.jar.  Currently, we have the following implementations:
-	com.chelseasystems.cs.tax.flatrate.CMSTaxFixedRateServices
-	com.chelseasystems.cs.tax.flatrate.CMSTaxStoreRateServices
-	com.chelseasystems.cs.tax.canada.CMSTaxCanadianServices
-	com.chelseasystems.cs.tax.taxware.CMSTaxTaxwareServices
ChelseaStore should be complied independent of cms_tax.jar.
CMSTaxStoreRateServices is the default implementation.

2.  Database changes: Regional Tax attributes are added to the item, 
line item detail and store tables.
