Ingenico (ET1000) device installation Instructions
==================================================

System Administer Overview:

1.	It is a JPOS device.
2.	Configuration file chelsea_jpos.xml lives on chelsea_store/files/prod/jpos.  
		Other JPOS devices should also be defined in this file.
3.	DTD file jcl.dtd is also located in the directory chelsea_store/files/prod/javapos.
4.	Properties file: jpos.properties should be in a directory jpos.res in the classpath.  
		This file defines where the chelsea_jpos.xml configuration should be.
5.	The following jar files are needed to be in classpath:  comm.jar, et1000jpos15201.jar, 
		jclall.jar, jpos15.jar (or jpos14.jar), and xerces.jar.


Configurations:

1.	Config file: client_master.cfg.  A new boot strap class should be added to the 
		parameter BOOT_STRAP - com.chelseasystems.cs.msr.ET1000BootStrap
2.	Config file: payment.cfg.  Parameter CREDIT_CARD.BUILDER should points to the 
		class: com.chelseasystems.cs.swing.builder.ET1000CreditCardBldr
3.	Config file: msr.cfg.  MSR_DEVICE_TYPE, MSR_LOGICAL_NAME and other parameters 
		should be properly defined.
5.	.icf files are files define the layout of the screens (forms) display on the 
		device found in /chelsea_store/files/prod/jpos/ingenico.  These configuration 
		files allow user to change the message and company logo to be displayed.

		keyboard (non JPOS) MSR for consultant when the Ingenico device is present.
