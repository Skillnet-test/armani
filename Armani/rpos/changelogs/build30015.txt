Issues around setting appropriate security permissions.
    -Printing to a receipt printer will not work.
     This is the result of permissions not assigned in policy file.

    -Messaging is not allowed access to secure sockets.
     This is the result of permissions not assigned in policy file.

    -Application will not start. An access denied, security exception is thrown.
     This is the result of an unsigned jar.

These issues are currently being taken care of. IF these issues arise, fall back to previous(weak) policy 
files.
