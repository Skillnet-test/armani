1.  Date format

The format of dates in the XML files has changed.  
The old format was 

	MM/DD/YYYY hh:mm:ss.sss, 

which is unclear to people in Great Britain.  
The new format uses the International Standard ISO 8601

	YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sss  

2.  Deal is replaced by Promotion

Old deals was removed.  Deal Services and XML files are removed
Promotion Services is added.  Since Promotion is still under 
development, no promotion for this label.
