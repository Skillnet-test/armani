7. Special notes on serial communication

  Devices connected to serial ports can be controlled by serial port driver in
  JavaPOS.
  Such control is permitted only when you log on as root (as a default status).
  Use the following procedure to enable users, in addition to root, to control
  the devices.

  (1) Procedure common to Red Hat 6.2 and Red Hat 7.1

    (a) Add a user to the group that the /var/lock directory belongs to.

      After opening a serial port, the serial port driver creates a lock file in
      the /var/lock directory. General users do not have authority to access
      this file using the default configuration. Therefore, users who want to
      use the serial port must be added to the group that this lock directory
      belongs to. To add a user to the group, edit the /etc/group file. The
      /var/lock directory belongs to the uucp group.

        [Example on modifying the /etc/group file]
        The following example shows how to add a user jpos to the group by
        modifying the /etc/group file.

        Before modification            After modification
        uucp:x:14:uucp                 uucp:x:14:uucp,jpos

      To add more users, use a comma "," to separate the names. The following
      example shows how to add another user jpos2 in addition to jpos.

        Before modification            After modification
        uucp:x:14:uucp              uucp:x:14:uucp,jpos,jpos2

  (2) Procedure applicable to Red Hat 6.2 only

    For Red Hat 6.2, perform also the following procedure in addition to the
    procedure described above. Do not perform this procedure for Red Hat 7.1.

      (a) Change the authority to access serial ports.

        Use the chmod command to enable the write and read authorities to owner
        and group of serial ports.

          [Example]
          # chmod 0660 /dev/ttySX

        Note: Substitute the "X" with the number of the port that the device is
        connected to. When using two or more serial ports, run this command for
        each of the ports. 

      (b) Add users to the group that the serial ports belong to.

        After adding the group to the authority of serial ports, now add a user
        who uses serial ports to the group that the serial ports belong to. You
        can add a user to the group by editing the /etc/group file. Serial
        ports belong to the tty group.

          [Example on modifying the /etc/group file]
          The following example shows how to add the user "jpos".

            Before modification            After modification
            tty:x:5:                        tty:x:5:jpos

          To add more users, use a comma "," to separate the names. The
          following example shows how to add another user "jpos2" in addition
          to "jpos".

            Before modification            After modification
            tty:x:5:                       tty:x:5:jpos,jpos2

  (3) Restarting the PC

    Now, users in addition to root can access the serial ports.


8. Special notes on usage of USB device

  (1) Operating environment to use USB devices

    Use Red Hat 7.1 as the operating environment to use USB devices. USB
    devices are not available on Red Hat 6.2.

  (2) Usage of USB devices for general users

    Devices connected to USB ports can be controlled by USB port driver in
    JavaPOS. Such control is permitted only when you log on as root (as a
    default status).
    Use the following procedure to enable users, in addition to root, to control
    the devices.


      (a) Create a group to access USB. 

        Add a group to access USB.

          [Example]
          The following example shows how to add the user "jpos".
          # /usr/sbin/groupadd javapos

      (b) Add users to the group to access USB.

        After adding the group to access USB ports in (a), now add users who
        need to access USB ports to the group. To add a user to the group, edit
        the /etc/group file. The group ID for javapos is 501 in this example. 

          [Example on modifying the /etc/group file]
          The following example shows how to add a user jpos to the group by
          modifying the /etc/group file.

            Before modification            After modification
            javapos:x:501:                 javapos:x:501:jpos

          To add more users, use a comma "," to separate the names. The
          following example shows how to add another user jpos2 in addition to
          jpos.

            Before modification            After modification
            javapos:x:501:              javapos:x:501:jpos,jpos2

      (c) Modify /etc/fstab

        Add the following line to the /etc/fstab file to enable the defined
        group to access USB ports. Write the group ID of the group that access
        USB ports in devgid. The group ID is 501 in this example.

          [Example on modifying the /etc/fstab file]
          none    /proc/bus/usb    usbdevfs defaults,devmode=0660,devgid=501 0 0

      (d) Restart the PC

        Now, users in addition to root can access the USB ports.


9. Restriction

  (1) Controlling devices connected to Ethernet

    If a POS printer that is performing open and claim is turned off and on,
    JavaPOS tries to connect the PC and the POS printer automatically. However
    the re-connection is not guaranteed for the following reason. 

    After a POS printer is turned off and on, it can be connected from any PC
    on the network. At this moment, JavaPOS on the PC making the claim tries to
    reconnect automatically. However, if other PCs also try to make the claim,
    the first PC that sends connection request can connect to the PC. 

    When you connect the POS printer to Ethernet, the UB-E01 of EPSON's
    interface board is used. Because of its specification, the UB-E01 takes
    about 20 seconds to start network operation when the PC is turned on or
    reset. 

  (2) About the directIO method of POS printer

    Do not use command number POS PTR_DI_OUTPUT_REALTIME (101) and
    PTR_DI_RECOVER_ERROR (300) of the directIO method of a POS printer unless
    for emergency purposes such as canceling an error. This is because they
    output data to printer without any flow control. PTR_DI_OUTPUT_REALTIME and
    PTR_DI_RECOVER_ERROR may not be available for devices connected to Ethernet.

  (3) Using displayText(At) for line display

    When data is output to the line display in JavaPOS, a timeout period
    applies. Therefore, be sure to specify an amount of data that can fit in a
    screen. If too much data is specified, an error (JPOS_E_FAILURE) may occur.
    However, a logical window does not have this restriction.

  (4) Printing an image on a POS printer

    An image is scaled, in all cases, when printed on a POS printer. However,
    sometimes the image is converted inaccurately because of the function that
    Java2 SDK uses.

  (5) Keyboard hook driver

    Please note that the keyboard hook driver cannot be unloaded. However, the
    hook process can be stopped and restarted. Because the ScrollLock key
    process is not performed, be sure not to push it.

  (6) Serial port of COM5 and above

    Serial ports of COM5 and above have not been verified for operation at
    present. Please note that they cannot be used in certain environments.

  (7) Using TM-T90 or TM-L90
    When you use TM-T90/TM-L90, set the memory switch 8-5 off (2mm margin setting
    from right and left of the paper). When you use it with the memory switch 8-5
    turned on, 90-degree rotation print of the bar code cannot be done.


10. Others

  (1) About the "Segmentation Fault" error when the open method is executed:

    There is a possibility that the "Segmentation Fault" error may occur, depending
    on the PC environment, when the open method is executed.  The "Segmentation
    Fault" error is an error that is caused in the PC environment.

    If this error occurs, please change the Java environment as follows; however,
    if this error does not occur, it is not necessary to make this change.

    [Countermeasure]
      The stack size when it is default is limited to 2MB.

    [Procedure]
      When using bash: "ulimit -s 2048"
      When using tcsh: "limit stacksize 2048"

  (2) Status transmission from the printer at power on

    Some  printers are set to transmit three bytes of printer status to the host
    PC when the power is turned on again once JavaPOS is used. These data are
    used for telling the printer's power on to JavaPOS.
